I am a theoretical ecologist. I build mathematical models and combine analytical methods with numerical simulations to study the ecology and evolution of symbiosis. 

My research revolves around finding out the consequences of symbiosis at the individual- and population-levels. I am a member of the [Hurford](https://amyhurford.weebly.com/) and [Dufour](https://www.faculty.mun.ca/sdufour/index.php) labs.
