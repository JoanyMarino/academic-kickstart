For my Ph.D., I focus on two thyasirid bivalve species from Newfoundland, Canada, as a case study. These bivalves are [closely related](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/maec.12310), sympatric, show similar life history features, and are [particulate feeders](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1385110118301904). However, one species hosts [chemosynthetic bacteria](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24914799) that are digested as a supplementary resource, and the consequences of this association are not known. To understand the implications of symbiosis in the thyasirids, I use a mixture of dynamic energy budget theory, physiologically structured population models, and optimal control theory, plus growth and life history data.

Any attempt at understanding symbiosis must start by recognizing the relationship. For this reason, I also dedicate a fraction of my research to building a baseline knowledge of other symbiotic interactions in marine invertebrates, especially in the Caribbean region.
